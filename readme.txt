this project is fork of soundtouch for android

the official project website is

http://www.surina.net/soundtouch

I forked this project, and modified source code for fanplayer android platform

goto directory soundtouch\source\Android-lib\jni

run build.bat to build library for fanplayer android platform support.

after build done, you will get the libsoundtouch.a library file
and soundtouch\source\Android-lib\jni\soundtouch-lib.h is the header file
